        <p class="answer p-regular-16px-400">
          With the invention of the electric guitar and their magnetic pickups,
          the traditional guitar string manufacturers of the day had to evolve
          to keep up with this growing demand. However, since their arrival into
          the mainstream, electric guitar strings have remained relatively the
          same - as far as their basic composition and functionality.

          From the String to Speaker
        </p>
        <p class="answer p-regular-16px-400">
          Since the sound output from electric guitar strings is driven
          primarily by the magnetic properties of the materials in the
          composition of the strings, highly magnetic steel has become the
          standard for the core of these strings. Through electromagnetic
          induction, the electric guitar strings’ interaction with the magnetic
          pickups converts the strings’ vibrations into electrical impulses,
          which are then amplified to reach the desired output of the player and
          the intended audience.

        <p class="question">
          Gauges and Tensions
        </p>
        <p class="answer p-regular-16px-400">
          There are numerous electric guitar string options that differ by
          brands or manufactures, gauges or string tensions, material
          composition, manufacturing techniques, and a variety of treatments or
          coatings. All of these different string options were created to meet
          the needs of an infinite variety of guitar players and playing styles.
          The largest selection and most common types of electric guitar string
          sets are for the 6-string guitar, but there are also many options for
          electric 12-string guitars, 7-string guitars, 8-string guitars, and
          Baritone guitars.<br /><br />
          When deciding what type of electric guitar strings would work best for
          your electric guitar, experimenting with and deciding on a string
          gauge or tension is a good place to start. Heavy gauge strings are
          often louder due to more steel and a greater vibrating mass for the
          pickups to harness. However, heavy gauge strings can be much harder to
          play and often require a slight adjustment to your guitar’s bridge so
          that these thicker strings don’t cause fret buzz - which leads to a
          higher action and more effort to play overall. On the other hand,
          lighter gauge strings allow for your guitar’s action to be set up
          lower and are also much easier to play and bend, but they are not as
          loud as a heavier set.<br /><br />
          The gauges (thickness) of the string are often detailed on the package
          for easy comparison. They are usually written out starting with the
          1st string to the 6th string on standard 6-string sets, (ie. 10 - 46).
          Often, every string gauge is listed on the package along with the
          associated categories of the gauges (ie. Light 9, 11, 16, 24, 32,
          42).<br /><br />
          There are also many other categories of in-between and custom gauge
          sets that electric guitar string manufacturers supply to meet the
          dynamic needs of the guitar players, such as Extra Light, Light,
          Medium, Medium Heavy, and Heavy. These make it easier for players to
          easily compare the different string gauge options, and help categorize
          the gauges that players like for future buying.

        <p class="answer p-regular-16px-400">
          There are many guitar players that are so particular about the sound,
          feel, style, etc… of their guitar strings, that they piece together
          their own custom sets out of single electric guitar strings, and often
          from different manufacturers. If you found your perfect set of
          electric guitar strings from assembling your own custom set, you can

          Sound and Tone
        </p>
        <p class="answer p-regular-16px-400">
          The feel and sound of electric guitar strings are further shaped and
          enhanced by various manufacturing processes, outer string wrappings,
          treatments and coatings, and the overall materials used in the
          composition of the strings. Harder materials like plain steel strings
          lend to an overall brighter sound and greater volume, however they can
          tend to wear down a guitar’s frets and fretboard at a faster rate.

          Electric guitar strings made with softer metals like 24k gold and pure
          nickel can help produce warmer and more mellow sounding tones, and are
          a much less abrasive on guitar’s frets. Some recent advances in string
          materials, such as using cobalt, provides a higher magnetism to the
          magnetic pickups, resulting in increased output and clarity.

          <p class="p-regular-16px-400">
            There are a variety of other metals that are used in the
            construction
            of acoustic guitar strings, which help produce unique tonal
            qualities
            that many guitar players enjoy. Gold Plated acoustic guitar strings
            are somewhat more expensive, but the superior qualities of the gold
            help to make very long lasting strings with exceptional tonal
            qualities. Nickel Wound acoustic guitar strings are a popular choice
            for players who would rather hear the natural woody sounds of their
            acoustic guitars. Other types of acoustic guitar strings incorporate
            different materials into their core wires, such as silk and steel
            and
            silk and bronze, which help produce a more sweet and mellow tone,
            with
            a softer feel for easier playability. This chart shows where the
            different types of strings lie on the spectrum from bright to mellow
            sound.

          <p class="answer p-regular-16px-400">
            The outer winding process that is most often used on electric guitar
            strings is called Roundwound, which consists of a round wire that is
            wrapped around the core and helps to produce a brighter and louder
            tone.
            Flatwound electric guitar strings utilize a flatter wrap wire around
            the
            core, and are favored by many for their lower profile and
            comfortable
            playing experience. These flatwound strings also help to eliminate
            the
            finger squeak sounds produced when sliding from note to note. Some
            electric guitar strings are further manipulated with a finishing
            process
            that grinds down or polishes the outer windings, and some of the
            more
            common types are known as Half Rounds, or Burnished
            Strings.<br /><br />
            Many electric guitar strings have protective layers applied during
            the
            final manufacturing process, and these are known as treated and/or
            coated strings. These thin coatings on the strings help protect them
            from oxidation, dirt, and from the natural oils that comes from the
            players’ fingers. These coated strings also tend to last much longer
            due
            to this protective layer, as it also seals the small gaps in between
            the
            string windings, however there is much discussion as to the effect
            this
            has on the strings’ tone.

          <p class="p-regular-16px-400">
            Speaking of tone, electric guitar strings do not last forever and
            eventually the tone, sustain, and the feeling of the strings begin
            to
            deteriorate. This can occur from playing your strings too much and
            simply wearing them out, and also from the dirt and oils from your
            fingers that collect on the strings. Electric guitar strings can
            also
            deteriorate from not playing them at all, as the materials in the
            strings oxidize from the moisture in the air, as well as the dust
            that
            can collect on them over time.

            To keep your electric guitar sounding as good as possible and to
            achieve
            the fullest sonic potential from your instrument, fresh strings are
            essential. New strings are also much easier to play and they stay in
            tune much better. Experimenting with different strings is another
            great
            way to change the playability and to enhance the sound of your
            electric
            guitar, while you dial in your perfect tone. Like many guitarists,
            electric guitar players sometimes do not even realize that their
            strings
            have degraded due to their relative judgment. The gradual changes in
            their string quality over time often goes unnoticed, and the player
            forgets how easy it can be to tune and play, and how inspirational
            their
            guitar can truly sound.
